This is an example CV document to demonstrate the **`cv`** plugin. It uses the `oshea_plugin: "./cv.config.yaml"` key in its front matter, so it will automatically use the `cv` plugin's configuration when you run `oshea cv-example.md` from within the `plugins/cv/` directory.

The `cv` plugin is designed for creating professional-looking Curriculum Vitae documents.

For using the `cv` plugin with *other* Markdown documents by its name from any directory (e.g., `oshea convert my_actual_cv.md --plugin cv`), ensure it's registered in a main `oshea` configuration file. (It usually is by default in `config.example.yaml`).
