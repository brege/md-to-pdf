# Recipe Plugin (`recipe`)

This plugin is tailored for converting Markdown files formatted as individual recipes into well-structured PDF documents.

It typically uses the `title` field from the front matter as the main H1 heading and applies specific styling to make ingredients, directions, and other recipe elements clear and easy to follow.
