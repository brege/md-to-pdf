---

## Version 0.1.0: Initial Implementation (Completed)
## Version 0.2.0: Extensible Document Type Plugin Architecture (Completed)
## Version 0.2.1: Watch Mode Implementation (Completed)
## Version 0.2.2: Core Configuration Refactor (Completed)
## Version 0.3.0: XDG User Default Overrides (Completed)
## Version 0.3.1: Project-Specific Configuration Overrides (Completed)
## Version 0.3.2: Bundled Defaults Flag (Completed)
## Version 0.4.0: User-Defined Plugin Discovery & Loading (Completed)
## Version 0.4.1: Custom Plugin Test & README Update (Completed)
## Version 0.4.2: Math Support (KaTeX) (Completed)
## Version 0.4.4: User Aids & Plugin Listing (Partially Completed)
    * **Cheat Sheet Document:** Created `docs/CHEAT_SHEET.md`. (Completed)
    * **CLI Enhancement - `plugin list`:** Implemented. (Completed)

## Version 0.4.5: Refactoring for Plugin Robustness (Next Up)
    * **Goal:** Improve internal robustness before adding more plugin creation features.
    * **Key Tasks:**
        * Refactor `watch_handler.js` for extensible, plugin-defined watch paths (replacing hardcoded logic).
        * Finalize strategy for `DefaultHandler.js` accessibility in plugins generated by `plugin create`.

## Version 0.4.x: CLI Enhancements (Post-Refactoring)

* **CLI Enhancement - `plugin create`:**
    * **Goal:** Implement `md-to-pdf plugin create <pluginName>` to generate boilerplate for new simple plugins.
    * **Status:** To be implemented after v0.4.5 refactoring.
* **Schema for Plugin Configuration:**
    * **Goal:** Define and implement JSON schema validation for plugin `*.config.yaml` files to improve robustness.
    * **Status:** Future consideration.

## Version 0.5.0: Advanced Plugin Management & Extensibility (Future)

* **Goal:** Standardize and simplify the integration and management of plugins, especially those from external sources.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Automatic Plugin Directory Scanning:** Allow users to specify one or more directories (e.g., in XDG or project config) from which `md-to-pdf` will automatically discover and register valid plugins without explicit listing in a main `config.yaml`.
    * **External Plugin Management:** Document and potentially provide tooling support for integrating plugins managed as external entities (e.g., Git submodules, npm packages).
    * Plugin-specific help generation.

## Shelved/Reconsidered Features

* **Named Plugin Variants:**
    * **Original Goal (from `proposal-v0.4.0.md`):** Allow users to define multiple named configurations (variants) for the same base plugin handler.
    * **Decision (May 2025):** Shelved. The existing system for creating user-defined plugins (by copying and customizing an existing plugin) combined with the 3-tier configuration override mechanism provides sufficient flexibility for users to create stylistic or behavioral variations. The added complexity of a dedicated "variants" system was deemed unnecessary, especially since duplicating simple handler scripts has minimal overhead. For highly distinct themes or functionalities, creating a new, full plugin (potentially shared via community channels like GitHub) is a more robust and maintainable approach.

## Future Considerations (Post v0.5.0 / Parallel Tracks)

* **Advanced Plugin Capabilities:**
    * Asset Management (beyond CSS).
    * Templating Engine Support (standardized utilities).
    * Data Source Abstraction (beyond single Markdown or CLI args).
* **Enhanced Output Options:**
    * Direct HTML Output (the fully processed HTML sent to Puppeteer).
