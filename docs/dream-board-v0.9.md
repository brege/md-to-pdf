# Dream Board v0.9: System Hardening & Finalization

### Core Philosophy for v0.9.x

With the core functionalities of plugin management and the unified CLI largely in place by the end of the v0.8.x series, the v0.9.x series will focus on **system hardening, comprehensive testing, and final polish.** 

The goal is to enhance reliability, improve the developer experience for plugin creators, ensure user configurations are validated, and prepare `md-to-pdf` for a conceptual "1.0" level of stability and completeness.

### Objectives & Features

1. **Schema Validation for Plugin Configurations**
   * **Goal -** Improve the robustness and reliability of plugin configurations by introducing schema validation.
   
   * **Description** 
     - Define and implement a JSON schema for plugin `*.config.yaml` files. This will allow `md-to-pdf` to validate plugin configurations when they are loaded, providing clear error messages for malformed or incorrect structures. This will significantly aid plugin developers and users in diagnosing configuration issues.
   
   * **Impact** \
     Enhanced stability, better error reporting for plugin configurations, clearer contract for plugin authors.

2. **CLI-Based Integration Tests for CollectionsManager Functionality:**
   * **Goal -**  Implement the deferred "rigorous check" CLI-based integration tests for the core `md-to-pdf collection ...` and `md-to-pdf plugin ...` commands that were integrated in v0.8.x.
   
   * **Description**
     * Add a select set of end-to-end tests that use the `runCliCommand` helper to verify the main user workflows for adding collections, enabling/disabling plugins, etc. These tests will complement the direct module tests already in place for `CollectionsManager` (in `dev/test/cm-tests/`).
   
   * **Impact** \
     Increased confidence in the end-to-end behavior of the unified CLI commands for plugin and collection management. (Addresses the `[TODO]` in `dev/test/cm-tests/README.md`).

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage Review:**
   * **Goal -** Audit and expand overall test coverage for `md-to-pdf`.
   
   * **Description** 
     * Systematically review existing tests (both CLI-based in `dev/test/test-cases/` and module tests in `dev/test/cm-tests/`) to identify gaps. Add tests for edge cases, error conditions, and less commonly used features or options across the entire application.
   
   * **Impact** \
    Improved overall stability and reliability of the tool.

4. **Programmatic API Review and Stabilization (If Applicable):**
   * **Goal:** If `md-to-pdf` is to be promoted more formally as a Node.js library for programmatic use (beyond its CLI), review and stabilize its exported API (e.g., from `dev/index.js`).
   
   * **Description** 
     * Define what constitutes the public programmatic API. Ensure it is well-documented (e.g., with JSDoc comments) and that any planned breaking changes are considered carefully. If the focus remains primarily CLI, this objective might be minor.
   
   * **Impact** \
     Clearer path for other developers to integrate `md-to-pdf` functionalities into their own tools.

5. **Final Documentation Polish:**
   
   * **Goal -**  Conduct a final review and polish of all user and developer documentation after the v0.8.x documentation overhaul is complete.
   
   * **Description**
     * Ensure consistency, accuracy, clarity, and completeness across `README.md`, `plugin-development.md`, `cheat-sheet.md`, the CM `walkthrough.md`, and any other user-facing guides. Check for broken links, outdated examples, and areas that could be explained more clearly.
   
   * **Impact** \
     A highly polished and professional set of documentation for users and developers.
