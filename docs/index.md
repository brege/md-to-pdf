# md-to-pdf Project Documentation

This document is a central index for all documentation within the `md-to-pdf` repo.
It organizes Markdown files by categorical purpose and voicing (cf. [Di√°taxisk](https://diataxis.fr/) taxonomy),

**Active Documents and Checklists** \
*For convenience, these are symlinks to the latest version of each document below.*

- [**Linting Checklist**](linting-checklist.md): **Policy.**
  Linting and code quality strategy for the project.
* [**Release Candidate Checklist**](rc-checklist.md): **Hygiene.**
  Updating user docs and internal refactoring of code for ease of use.
* [**Reoganization Planner**](archive/v0.10/reorganization-planner.md): **Planning.**
  Strategy for the final polish, reorganization, and AI integration push.
* [**Dream Board**](dream-board.md): **Standardization**. 
  Focuses on testing, plugin architecture, and the remaining task-paths to v1.0.

There are also several indexes for the main components of the project.

**Indexes:**
[ [**Docs**](index.md) ]
[ [**Scripts**](../scripts/index.md) ]
[ [**Plugins**](../plugins/index.md) ]
[ [**Tests**](../test/index.md) ]

These indices are automatically managed by
[**`scripts/linting/docs/update-project-indices.js`**](../scripts/linting/docs/update-project-indices.js)
and configure via
[`.index-config.yaml`](../.index-config.yaml)
at the project root.

## 3. Architecture & Reasoning (Explanation)

*Discussions that explore the context and reasoning behind project decisions.*

### High-Level Vision & History
*The main "living" and archived documents of the project's evolution and direction--updated in commit timescales*

* [**Release Candidate Checklist**](rc-checklist.md): **Hygiene**. 
  Updating user docs and internal refactoring of code for ease of use.

- [**v0.10 Architecture Evolution**](docs/archive/v0.10/)
  - [Reorganization Planner for `src/`](docs/archive/v0.10/reorganization-planner.md).
    Housekeeping task to move-on from a flat `src/` directory along with [a progress report](archive/v0.10/test-refactor-require-path-progress.md).
  - [Fixing `test/` paths after re-organizing `src/`](docs/archive/v0.10/test-refactor-require-path-progress.md).
    Brittle assert and import patterns requiring several slices of refactory.
  - [Replacing `src/` paths to new Pathing Registry](archive/v0.10/replace-src-paths.md).
    Moving on to a central pathing registry to not repeat mistakes.  cf. [*Why I Should Make a Pathing Registry*](archive/v0.10/why-i-should-make-a-pathing-registry.md).
  - [Replacing `test/` paths to new Pathing Registry](archive/v0.10/replace-test-paths.md).
    Again fixing brittle test framework.
  - [**Index of Scripting Tools used during Refactor**](archive/v0.10/scripts.refactor.index.md). 
    Many of these scripts were parted out for linters to re-enforce updated standards.
    These clickthroughs resolve to GitHub, snapshotted at
    [v0.10.31](https://github.com/brege/md-to-pdf/releases/tag/v0.10.31),
    as the `scripts/refactor/` directory was removed.
* [**Dream Board v0.9**](archive/v0.9/dream-board-v0.9.md): **Standardization**.
  Focuses on testing, plugin architecture, and the remaining task-paths to v1.0.
  Muxes changelogs, task checklists, and outlook from a central, living document.
* [Dream Board v0.8](archive/v0.8/dream-board-v0.8.md): **Unification**. 
  Merges plugin and collection management under a single CLI.
* [Dream Board v0.7](archive/v0.7/dream-board-v0.7.md): **Plugin Installation**.
  Introduces the Collections Manager concept.
* [Changelog v0.8](archive/v0.8/changelog-v0.8.md):
  Chronologically lists the major changes in the v0.8.x series.
* [Changelog v0.7](archive/v0.7/changelog-v0.7.md):
  Chronologically lists the major changes in the v0.7.x series.
* [Roadmap](archive/v0.6/roadmap.md):

* [Should We Have Used a Config Library?](archive/v0.6/should-we-have-used-a-config-library.md):
  Journals the choices between bespoke config-system versus adopting a config library.
* [Plugin Validation Philosophy](archive/v0.9/schema-validation-philosophy.md):
  Explains the "warn, don't fail" approach to configuration schema validation.
* [Purge Command Deferral](archive/v0.8/should-cm-purge-orphans.md):
  Details the reasoning for deferring a potentially dangerous "purge" feature in favor of user data safety.
* [Test Structure Evolution](archive/v0.8/current-vs-proposed-test-structure.md):
  Provides an early look at the *ad hoc* brittle, mostly end-to-end, test structure before 
  [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), before test grouping.
* [Tab Completion Assay](archive/v0.9/tab-completion-assay.md):
  Breaks down tab-completion schemes into difficulty levels, design pathways, examples, and an optimal approach.
* [**Reorganization Planner**](archive/v0.10/reorganization-planner.md):
  Planning strategy for the final polish, reorganization, and AI integration push.
* [An Argument for Adding a Pathing Registry](archive/v0.10/why-i-should-make-a-pathing-registry.md):
