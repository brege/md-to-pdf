# test/assets/override_config/cv_test.yaml
# This is the main project config file, passed via --config.
# It defines direct overrides for the 'cv' plugin.
# The 'cv' plugin itself is assumed to be registered via a lower-precedence
# mechanism (e.g., config.example.yaml, which is used as a fallback
# if this file doesn't register 'cv' under a 'plugins:' key).

cv: # Top-level key matching the plugin name, providing overrides
