## Test Harness and QA Dashboard

This directory contains all assets related to testing the `md-to-pdf` application, including integration tests, end-to-end (E2E) tests, and the scripts that power this QA dashboard.

### QA System Overview

The test status is not just manually tracked; it is dynamically generated by analyzing the state of the codebase and the test documentation itself.

**Source of Truth**
* `test/docs/checklist-level-?.md`: These files contain the master list of all planned test scenarios for each level of testing.
* `test/docs/audit-log.md`: This file documents known issues, limitations, or reasons why a test might be skipped.

**QA Scripts**
* The scripts in `test/scripts/` are used to parse the checklists, the audit log, and the test files themselves (`*.test.js`).
* They generate a consolidated report on any tests that are not in a "completed and passing" state.

## How to Update the Dashboard

To update the table below, run the following command from the **project root**:

```bash
node test/scripts/qa-dashboard.js --update-readme
```

These items are the kinds that *do not* get picked up by a CI. These tests are of three categories, and each category has its own script

1. [`find-nonclosed-audits.js`](scripts/find-nonclosed-audits.js)
   tests that are in the [audit log](audit-log.md) and have not been marked as `CLOSED`
2. [`find-unchecked-tests.js`](scripts/find-unchecked-tests.js)
   tests that are unchecked in the [checklist](checklist-level-[1-4].md)
3. [`find-skipped-tests.js`](scripts/find-skipped-tests.js) 
   tests that have been skipped via `it.skip()` in the `*.test.js` files

The [`qa-dashboard.js`](scripts/qa-dashboard.js) script synthesizes this information into the table below.
