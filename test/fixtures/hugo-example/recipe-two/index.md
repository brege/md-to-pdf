## Overnight Country Blonde Sourdough

**Chef:** Artisan Baker (Inspired by Ken Forkish)

This recipe is adapted from the principles in Ken Forkish's "Flour Water Salt Yeast," focusing on an overnight fermentation for a flavorful and moderately open crumb. Exact timings will depend on your starter activity and ambient temperature.

### Ingredients:

**Levain (Build 4-6 hours before mixing final dough):**
-   50g mature sourdough starter (100% hydration)
-   100g all-purpose flour (or a mix of 75g AP, 25g whole wheat)
-   100g water (around 80-85°F / 27-29°C)

**Final Dough:**
-   450g all-purpose flour
-   50g whole wheat flour (or rye flour for more flavor)
-   360-380g water (around 90-95°F / 32-35°C) - adjust based on flour absorption
-   200g active levain (all of the above build)
-   11g fine sea salt

### Equipment:
-   Large mixing bowl or tub
-   Digital kitchen scale
-   Dutch oven (5 to 7 quart)
-   Proofing basket (banneton) lined with a floured towel or rice flour
-   Bench scraper
-   Lame or sharp knife for scoring

### Instructions:

**1. Build the Levain (Morning/Afternoon):**
   - In a clean jar or bowl, mix the mature starter, flour, and water for the levain.
   - Cover loosely and let it ferment at room temperature (ideally 70-75°F / 21-24°C) for 4-6 hours, or until it has at least doubled, is very active, and passes the "float test" (a small spoonful floats in water).

**2. Autolyse (Evening - when levain is almost ready):**
   - In your large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and 360g of the final dough water.
   - Mix until no dry flour remains. Cover and let it rest for 20-60 minutes. This allows the flour to hydrate.

**3. Mix Final Dough (Evening):**
   - Add the 200g of active levain to the autolysed dough. Pinch and fold it in to incorporate.
   - Add the 11g of salt.
   - Use the remaining 20g of water (if needed) to help dissolve and incorporate the salt. Mix thoroughly using folds in the bowl or pincer method for 3-5 minutes until the dough starts to come together. The dough will be sticky.

**4. Bulk Fermentation (Evening - approx. 3-4 hours with folds):**
   - Let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
   - Perform the first set of folds: Wet your hands, grab one side of the dough, stretch it up, and fold it over the center. Rotate the bowl and repeat 3 more times (like folding an envelope).
   - Repeat these folds every 30-45 minutes for the first 2-3 hours of bulk fermentation.
   - The total bulk fermentation time will be around 3-5 hours at room temperature, or until the dough has increased in volume by about 30-50% and shows signs of good aeration (some bubbles on the surface, jiggly).

**5. Shape and Cold Proof (Late Evening/Night):**
   - Gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
   - Pre-shape into a round (boule). Let it rest, seam-side down, for 15-20 minutes, covered.
   - Final shape the dough into a tight boule or batard.
   - Place the shaped dough seam-side up into your well-floured proofing basket.
   - Cover the basket with a plastic bag or shower cap and immediately refrigerate for 12-18 hours (overnight).

**6. Bake (Next Morning/Afternoon):**
   - At least 45-60 minutes before baking, place your Dutch oven (lid on) into your oven and preheat to 475-500°F (245-260°C).
   - Once preheated, carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven.
   - Gently invert the cold dough from the proofing basket onto a piece of parchment paper.
   - Score the top of the dough with a lame or sharp knife (e.g., a simple cross, square, or single long slash).
   - Carefully lower the dough (on the parchment paper) into the hot Dutch oven.
   - Cover with the lid and return to the oven.
   - Bake for 20-25 minutes covered.
   - Remove the lid and continue baking for another 20-30 minutes, or until the crust is deeply caramelized and the internal temperature reaches around 205-210°F (96-99°C).
   - Carefully remove the bread from the Dutch oven and place it on a wire rack.
   - Let it cool completely (at least 2-3 hours, preferably longer) before slicing. This is crucial for the crumb structure.
