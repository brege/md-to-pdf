## Classic Tempura Batter

**Chef:** Culinary Explorer

This light and crispy tempura batter is perfect for vegetables, shrimp, or fish. The key is to keep the ingredients very cold and to mix minimally to avoid developing gluten.

### Ingredients:

-   1 large egg yolk (very cold)
-   1 cup ice-cold water (almost freezing, with some ice chips is fine)
-   1 cup all-purpose flour (sifted, or use cake flour for extra lightness)
-   Optional: 1-2 tablespoons cornstarch or potato starch (mixed with the flour for extra crispiness)
-   Oil for frying (e.g., vegetable, canola, peanut oil - enough for at least 1-2 inches depth)

### Equipment:
-   Mixing bowl
-   Whisk or chopsticks
-   Deep fryer or heavy-bottomed pot/wok
-   Thermometer for frying (optional but recommended)
-   Slotted spoon or spider for frying
-   Wire rack set over a baking sheet

### Instructions:

**1. Prepare Ingredients & Station:**
   - Ensure your egg yolk and water are extremely cold. Some chefs even chill the flour and bowl.
   - Sift the flour (and starch, if using) into a separate bowl.
   - Prepare all items you plan to fry: wash, pat dry thoroughly, and cut into appropriate sizes. Dusting them very lightly with a bit of flour can help the batter adhere.
   * Set up your frying station with the oil, batter station, items to be fried, and a wire rack for draining cooked tempura.

**2. Make the Batter (Just Before Frying):**
   - In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the very cold egg yolk.
   - Add the ice-cold water to the egg yolk and whisk briefly to combine. *Do not overmix.*
   - Add the sifted flour (and starch, if using) all at once to the wet ingredients.
   - Mix *very briefly* with a whisk or chopsticks. A few quick strokes are enough. The batter should be lumpy and thin – this is crucial for a light, crispy tempura. Overmixing develops gluten and results in a heavy, doughy coating. It should resemble a very thin pancake batter with visible flour lumps.

**3. Fry the Tempura:**
   - Heat your frying oil in a deep fryer or heavy pot to 340-360°F (170-180°C). Use a thermometer for accuracy. If you don't have one, a drop of batter should sizzle and float without browning too quickly.
   - Dip your prepared vegetables or seafood into the batter, allowing any excess to drip off.
   - Carefully place the battered items into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pot (this lowers the oil temperature).
   - Fry for a few minutes per side, depending on the item, until the batter is a very light golden color and crispy. Vegetables will cook faster than shrimp or fish.
   - Use a slotted spoon or spider to remove the cooked tempura from the oil, allowing excess oil to drip back into the pot.
   - Place the cooked tempura on the wire rack to drain. Do not place on paper towels directly, as this can make them steam and lose crispiness.

**4. Serving:**
   - Serve immediately with a traditional tempura dipping sauce (tentsuyu), grated daikon radish, and a bit of ginger if desired.

**Tips for Crispy Tempura:**
-   **Keep everything COLD:** Cold ingredients inhibit gluten development.
-   **DO NOT OVERMIX:** Lumps are your friends.
-   **Make batter just before use:** Don't let it sit around.
-   **Fry in small batches:** Maintains oil temperature.
-   **Use sifted flour:** For a lighter texture.
