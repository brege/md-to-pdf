## Example Recipe Title

**Chef:** Culinary Enthusiast

### Ingredients:

-   2 cups All-Purpose Flour
-   1 tsp Baking Powder
-   1/2 tsp Salt
-   1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
-   1 large Egg
-   1 cup Milk
-   2 tbsp Unsalted Butter, melted

### Directions:

1.  In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
2.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and melted butter until well combined.
3.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.
4.  Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
5.  Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake.
6.  Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.
7.  Serve immediately with your favorite toppings.
