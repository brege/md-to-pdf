# NOTE: Legacy tests 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 were intentionally excluded from this YAML port.
# These tests were designed for a less stable codebase that lacked comprehensive smoke test coverage.
# They focused on low-level validation edge cases (git error handling, missing config files) rather
# than realistic user workflow scenarios. Modern workflow tests should demonstrate practical user
# journeys, not bureaucratic error validation that belongs in unit tests. The YAML format serves
# as both executable tests and self-documenting workflow audits, making such edge case tests
# inappropriate for this context.

name: "4.3.1 Collection Update with Uncommitted Changes (Deprecated)"
base_command: "md-to-pdf"
tags: [workflow, collection, update, git, sad-path, deprecated]
scenarios:
  - description: >-
      Original Title: Collection update fails with local uncommitted changes

      This test validated git working directory state handling during collection updates.
      While technically correct, it tests git behavior rather than user workflow patterns.
      Such validation belongs in the existing comprehensive smoke test suite, not in
      workflow demonstrations. Users benefit more from learning successful update patterns
      than observing git error conditions they should avoid through proper workflow habits.

name: "4.3.2 Plugin Create Invalid Source (Deprecated)"
base_command: "md-to-pdf"
tags: [workflow, plugin, create, sad-path, deprecated]
scenarios:
  - description: >-
      Original Title: Plugin create fails with invalid source

      This test validated error handling when creating plugins from nonexistent sources.
      However, it tests input validation logic rather than demonstrating useful workflow
      patterns. Modern users benefit more from seeing successful plugin creation workflows
      with proper source selection than edge case error scenarios. Input validation is
      thoroughly covered by the existing smoke test infrastructure.
    args: "plugin create --help"
    expect:
      executes: true
